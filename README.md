# HSBDC Submission
 
Files I used for STEM Fellowship Journal's High School Big Data Challenge, including the files I used just to practice and learn libraries. Didn't end up winning but still an awesome learning experience. 

Datasets have been taken out for now while I figure out how to properly attribute them. As such, all the scripts are also broken (for now). All the datasets are from either Kaggle or the Our World in Data project.
